Key Point,7,"Elastic Block Store (EBS) - Persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances that persist independently from instance life, offering high availability and durability.","How does Elastic Block Store (EBS) differ from Instance Store, and what are the EBS volume types?"
Key Point,8,"Instance Store - Temporary block-level storage for EC2 instances; data is lost when the instance stops or terminates, but offers very high IOPS performance.","What are the use cases for Instance Store volumes versus EBS volumes?"
Key Point,9,"Security Groups - Act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic to instances, operating at the instance level with stateful rules.","How do Security Groups enhance EC2 instance security, and what are the default rules?"
Key Point,10,"Key Pairs - SSH keys used to securely connect to EC2 instances, consisting of a public key stored by AWS and a private key downloaded to your computer.","What are EC2 Key Pairs, and how do they enable secure access to instances?"
Key Point,11,"Elastic IP Addresses - Static IPv4 addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing, allowing you to remap addresses to different instances as needed.","What is the purpose of Elastic IP Addresses in EC2, and what are the costs associated with them?"
Key Point,12,"User Data - Scripts that run at the instance's first launch to automate configurations, software installation, and application setup.","How does User Data work in EC2, and what are common use cases for User Data scripts?"
Key Point,13,"Instance Metadata - Provides information about the instance accessible from within the instance itself, including instance ID, security groups, and temporary credentials.","What information is available through EC2 Instance Metadata, and how do you access it?"
Key Point,14,"Placement Groups - Logical groupings of instances to influence placement strategy: Cluster (low latency), Spread (isolated), and Partition (rack-level isolation).","What are the different EC2 Placement Group types, and when should each be used?"
Key Point,15,"Auto Scaling - Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances to handle load changes, ensuring you have the right capacity at all times.","How does EC2 Auto Scaling work, and what metrics can trigger scaling events?"
Key Point,16,"Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances for fault tolerance and improved application availability.","Explain the function of Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and how it works with Auto Scaling."
Key Point,17,"Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) - Pre-configured templates for instances containing operating system, application server, and applications, enabling fast instance launches.","What is the purpose of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), and how do you create custom AMIs?"
Key Point,18,"EC2 Instance Lifecycle - States include pending, running, stopping, stopped, shutting-down, and terminated. Understanding lifecycle helps with billing and state management.","What happens during each stage of the EC2 instance lifecycle, and how does billing work for each state?"
Key Point,19,"CloudWatch Monitoring - Provides metrics and logs for EC2 instances, including CPU utilization, network traffic, disk I/O, and custom application metrics.","What EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch, and how can you create custom metrics?"
Key Point,20,"EC2 Instance Connect - Browser-based SSH access to instances without requiring SSH keys, providing secure temporary access through the AWS console.","How does EC2 Instance Connect work, and what are its advantages over traditional SSH access?"
Key Point,21,"EC2 Hibernate - Preserve the in-memory state of instances when stopped, allowing faster startup times by restoring exact state rather than fresh boot.","What is EC2 Hibernate, and what are its requirements and limitations?"
Key Point,22,"EC2 Spot Fleet - Manage a collection of Spot Instances (and optionally On-Demand instances) to meet capacity needs with automatic diversification across instance types and AZs.","How does EC2 Spot Fleet differ from individual Spot Instances, and what are its benefits?"
Key Point,23,"EC2 Dedicated Instances - Instances that run on hardware dedicated to a single customer account, providing additional isolation without the full control of Dedicated Hosts.","What is the difference between EC2 Dedicated Instances and Dedicated Hosts?"
Key Point,24,"EC2 Launch Templates - Define instance configurations for Auto Scaling and Spot Fleet, providing version control and consistency for instance launches.","What are EC2 Launch Templates, and how do they improve upon Launch Configurations?"
Key Point,25,"EC2 Enhanced Networking - Provides higher network performance, lower latency, and lower jitter using SR-IOV technology, available on certain instance types.","What is EC2 Enhanced Networking, and which instance types support it?"
Key Point,26,"EC2 Instance Store Volumes - Ephemeral storage directly attached to the physical host, providing very high IOPS but data is lost on instance termination.","What are the performance characteristics of Instance Store volumes, and when should they be used?"
Key Point,27,"EC2 Termination Protection - Prevents accidental termination of instances by blocking terminate requests, useful for critical production instances.","How do you enable termination protection for EC2 instances, and what are best practices?"
Key Point,28,"EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDSv2) - Enhanced metadata service that requires session authentication tokens, providing better security against SSRF attacks.","What are the security improvements in IMDSv2 compared to IMDSv1, and why should you use it?"
Key Point,29,"EC2 Capacity Reservations - Reserve capacity for On-Demand instances in a specific AZ for any duration, ensuring capacity is available when needed.","How do EC2 Capacity Reservations work, and how do they differ from Reserved Instances?"
Key Point,30,"EC2 Instance Types Naming - Instance types follow the pattern: family.generation.size (e.g., t3.micro), where family indicates the use case, generation shows iteration, and size shows resource allocation.","How do you interpret EC2 instance type names, and what does each component indicate?"

Default rules: all inbound denied, all outbound allowed.","How do Security Groups enhance EC2 instance security, and what are the default rules?"
Key Point,10,"EC2 Key Pairs: Public-private key pairs for secure SSH/RDP access. Public key stored by AWS, private key downloaded (must keep secure).

Use Cluster for HPC, Spread for critical apps, Partition for distributed databases.","What are the different EC2 Placement Group types, and when should each be used?"
Key Point,15,"EC2 Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts number of instances based on demand. Works by: monitoring CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, custom), scaling policies (target tracking, step scaling, simple scaling), maintaining desired capacity. Triggers: CPU utilization, network traffic, custom metrics, scheduled actions. Scales out (add instances) when load increases, scales in (remove instances) when load decreases.","How does EC2 Auto Scaling work, and what metrics can trigger scaling events?"

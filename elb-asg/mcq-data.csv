Question,OptionA,OptionB,OptionC,OptionD,CorrectAnswer,Explanation
"What is an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and what are its main benefits?","An ELB is a physical hardware device that must be installed in your data center to distribute traffic across EC2 instances with manual configuration and maintenance required","An Elastic Load Balancer is a managed load balancer that distributes traffic across multiple downstream servers. Benefits: AWS guarantees it will be working, AWS handles upgrades/maintenance/high availability, integrated with EC2/ECS/ACM/CloudWatch/Route 53, provides SSL termination, health checks, and high availability across zones.","An ELB is a software application that runs on EC2 instances and requires manual installation, configuration, and ongoing maintenance by the user","ELBs can only distribute traffic within a single Availability Zone and cannot provide high availability or integrate with other AWS services","B","An Elastic Load Balancer is a managed load balancer. AWS guarantees that it will be working. AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability. It is integrated with many AWS offerings: EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon ECS, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch, Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator."
"What are the four types of Load Balancers available in AWS?","AWS provides only two load balancer types: Classic Load Balancer and Application Load Balancer, with no other options available","AWS has 4 kinds of managed Load Balancers: Classic Load Balancer (v1 - old generation, 2009) - HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL; Application Load Balancer (v2, 2016) - HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket; Network Load Balancer (v2, 2017) - TCP, TLS, UDP; Gateway Load Balancer (2020) - operates at layer 3 (Network layer - IP Protocol). It is recommended to use newer generation load balancers.","All load balancer types provide identical functionality with the same features, performance, and pricing, making the choice purely cosmetic","Load balancers can only be used with EC2 instances and cannot integrate with container services, serverless functions, or other AWS compute services","B","AWS has 4 kinds of managed Load Balancers: Classic Load Balancer (v1 - old generation) – 2009 – CLB; Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) – 2016 – ALB; Network Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) – 2017 – NLB; Gateway Load Balancer – 2020 – GWLB. Overall, it is recommended to use the newer generation load balancers as they provide more features."
"What is the difference between Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB)?","ALB and NLB are identical load balancers with the same features, performance characteristics, and use cases, making them interchangeable","Application Load Balancer (ALB) operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS), supports content-based routing, path-based routing, host-based routing, WebSocket, SSL termination, and container support. Network Load Balancer (NLB) operates at Layer 4 (TCP/TLS/UDP), provides extreme performance, static IP addresses, handles millions of requests per second, and is best for high-performance TCP workloads.","ALB can only be used for HTTP traffic while NLB can only be used for HTTPS traffic, with no support for other protocols or routing capabilities","ALB requires manual configuration and maintenance while NLB is fully automated, with no other differences in functionality or performance","B","Application Load Balancer (ALB) is Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS), load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups), load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine. Network Load Balancer (NLB) is Layer 4 (TCP, TLS, UDP), extreme performance, static IP, handles millions of requests."
"How do Load Balancer Health Checks work, and why are they important?","Health checks are automatically performed by AWS without any configuration, and they only verify that instances are running without checking application functionality","Health Checks enable the load balancer to know if instances are available to reply to requests. The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common). If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy and traffic is stopped. Health checks are crucial for ensuring only healthy instances receive traffic.","Health checks can only be configured for HTTP traffic and cannot be used with TCP, HTTPS, or other protocols, limiting their effectiveness for non-web applications","Load balancer health checks require manual intervention to remove unhealthy instances, as they cannot automatically stop routing traffic to failed instances","B","Health Checks are crucial for Load Balancers. They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests. The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common). If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy."
"What is Connection Draining (Deregistration Delay) in Load Balancers?","Connection draining automatically terminates all active connections immediately when an instance is deregistered, ensuring instant removal from the load balancer","Connection Draining (CLB) / Deregistration Delay (ALB & NLB) is the time to complete in-flight requests while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy. Stops sending new requests to the EC2 instance which is de-registering. Between 1 to 3600 seconds (default: 300 seconds). Can be disabled (set value to 0). Set to a low value if your requests are short.","Connection draining can only be enabled for Application Load Balancers and is not available for Network Load Balancers or Classic Load Balancers","Connection draining requires manual configuration for each instance and cannot be automatically managed by the load balancer during scaling events","B","Connection Draining – for CLB. Deregistration Delay – for ALB & NLB. Time to complete in-flight requests while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy. Stops sending new requests to the EC2 instance which is de-registering. Between 1 to 3600 seconds (default: 300 seconds). Can be disabled (set value to 0)."
"What is an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and what are its main purposes?","Auto Scaling Groups automatically resize EC2 instances vertically by changing instance types, with no support for horizontal scaling or adding/removing instances","An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) automatically scales EC2 instances based on demand. Main purposes: Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match increased load, Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match decreased load, Ensure minimum and maximum number of EC2 instances running, Automatically register new instances to a load balancer, Re-create EC2 instances if previous ones are terminated (ex: if unhealthy). ASGs are free (you only pay for underlying EC2 instances).","ASGs can only scale instances within a single Availability Zone and cannot distribute instances across multiple AZs for high availability","Auto Scaling Groups require manual intervention for each scaling action and cannot automatically adjust capacity based on metrics or demand","B","The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to: Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load, Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load, Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of EC2 instances running, Automatically register new instances to a load balancer, Re-create an EC2 instance in case a previous one is terminated (ex: if unhealthy).

Also requires: Min Size / Max Size / Initial Capacity, Scaling Policies.","ASG configuration is automatically determined by AWS based on application type, with no manual setup or configuration options available to users","Auto Scaling Groups can only be configured using command-line tools and cannot be set up through the AWS Console or CloudFormation templates","B","Auto Scaling Group Attributes: A Launch Template (older Launch Configurations are deprecated) - AMI + Instance Type, EC2 User Data, EBS Volumes, Security Groups, SSH Key Pair, IAM Roles for your EC2 Instances, Network + Subnets Information, Load Balancer Information. Min Size / Max Size / Initial Capacity, Scaling Policies."
"How does Auto Scaling integrate with CloudWatch for dynamic scaling?","CloudWatch integration requires manual monitoring and scaling actions, as ASGs cannot automatically respond to CloudWatch alarms or metrics","Auto Scaling integrates with CloudWatch by scaling based on CloudWatch alarms. An alarm monitors a metric (such as Average CPU, or a custom metric). Metrics such as Average CPU are computed for the overall ASG instances. Based on the alarm: We can create scale-out policies (increase the number of instances), We can create scale-in policies (decrease the number of instances).","CloudWatch alarms can only trigger scaling for CPU metrics and cannot be used with custom metrics, network traffic, or other performance indicators","Auto Scaling Groups automatically scale based on time of day only and cannot integrate with CloudWatch metrics or alarms for dynamic scaling","B","It is possible to scale an ASG based on CloudWatch alarms. An alarm monitors a metric (such as Average CPU, or a custom metric). Metrics such as Average CPU are computed for the overall ASG instances. Based on the alarm: We can create scale-out policies (increase the number of instances), We can create scale-in policies (decrease the number of instances)."
"What are the different Auto Scaling scaling policies available?","Auto Scaling only supports manual scaling where administrators must manually add or remove instances based on observed demand","Auto Scaling Scaling Policies: Target Tracking Scaling - Simple to set-up, example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%. Simple / Step Scaling - When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units; When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1. Scheduled Scaling - Anticipate scaling based on known usage patterns, example: increase the min capacity to 10 at 5 pm on Fridays. Predictive Scaling - Continuously forecast load and schedule scaling ahead.","Scaling policies are automatically configured by AWS based on instance type and cannot be customized or modified by users","All scaling policies provide identical functionality with the same performance and cost characteristics, making the choice purely based on personal preference","B","Dynamic Scaling: Target Tracking Scaling - Simple to set-up, Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%.

Scheduled Scaling - Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns, Example: increase the min capacity to 10 at 5 pm on Fridays. Predictive scaling: continuously forecast load and schedule scaling ahead."
"What metrics can be used to trigger Auto Scaling policies?","Auto Scaling can only use CPU utilization metrics and cannot monitor or scale based on other performance indicators or custom metrics","Auto Scaling can use various CloudWatch metrics: CPUUtilization (Average CPU), RequestCountPerTarget (number of requests per target in target group), Average Network In/Out (network traffic), Custom metrics (any metric you send to CloudWatch), Any CloudWatch metric. Metrics are computed for the overall ASG instances.","Scaling metrics are automatically selected by AWS and cannot be customized or changed by users, limiting flexibility in scaling configuration","Auto Scaling metrics can only be monitored for a single instance at a time and cannot aggregate metrics across multiple instances in an ASG","B","Metrics that can be used: CPUUtilization: Average CPU, RequestCountPerTarget: number of requests per target in target group, Average Network In/Out: network traffic, Custom metrics: any metric you send to CloudWatch, Any CloudWatch metric. Metrics such as Average CPU are computed for the overall ASG instances."
"What is the relationship between Auto Scaling Groups and Load Balancers?","Auto Scaling Groups and Load Balancers are independent services that cannot be integrated, requiring manual instance registration and health check configuration","Auto Scaling Groups can automatically register new instances with a Load Balancer when scaling out. The Load Balancer performs health checks on instances. If an instance fails health checks, the ASG can terminate and replace it. This integration ensures: New instances are automatically added to the load balancer, Unhealthy instances are automatically removed and replaced, Traffic is distributed across healthy instances, High availability is maintained across multiple AZs.","Load balancers can only be used with manually managed EC2 instances and cannot integrate with Auto Scaling Groups for automatic instance management","The integration between ASGs and Load Balancers requires manual configuration for each scaling event and cannot be automated","B","Auto Scaling Groups automatically register new instances to a load balancer. ELB can check the health of your EC2 instances. If instances fail health checks, the ASG can terminate and replace them, ensuring only healthy instances receive traffic."
"What are the benefits of deploying Load Balancers and Auto Scaling Groups across multiple Availability Zones?","Multi-AZ deployment increases costs without providing any availability or performance benefits compared to single-AZ deployments","Deploying across multiple Availability Zones provides: High Availability - if one AZ fails, traffic continues to other AZs, Fault Tolerance - automatic failover to healthy instances in other AZs, Better Performance - traffic distributed geographically, Compliance - meet requirements for multi-AZ deployments, Disaster Recovery - survive AZ-level failures. Load Balancers distribute traffic across AZs, and ASGs maintain capacity across multiple AZs.","Multi-AZ deployment is only available for Enterprise support plan customers and cannot be used with standard AWS accounts","Load balancers and ASGs can only operate within a single Availability Zone and cannot span multiple AZs for high availability","B","High Availability: Run instances for the same application across multi AZ. Auto Scaling Group multi AZ. Load Balancer multi AZ. This ensures availability if one AZ fails and provides better performance and fault tolerance."
"What is the difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling in the context of EC2?","Vertical and horizontal scaling are identical concepts that both refer to increasing instance capacity through the same methods","Vertical Scaling: Increase instance size (scale up/down) - From t2.nano (0.5G of RAM, 1 vCPU) to u-12tb1.metal (12.3 TB of RAM, 448 vCPUs). Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of instances (scale out/in) - Use Auto Scaling Group and Load Balancer. High Availability: Run instances for the same application across multi AZ using Auto Scaling Group multi AZ and Load Balancer multi AZ.","Vertical scaling requires manual intervention while horizontal scaling is always automatic, with no other differences in functionality or use cases","Scaling can only be performed vertically by upgrading instance types, as horizontal scaling through multiple instances is not supported by AWS","B","Vertical Scaling: Increase instance size (= scale up / down) - From: t2.nano - 0.5G of RAM, 1 vCPU; To: u-12tb1.metal – 12.3 TB of RAM, 448 vCPUs. Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of instances (= scale out / in) - Auto Scaling Group, Load Balancer."
"What are Launch Templates and how do they differ from Launch Configurations?","Launch Templates and Launch Configurations are identical with no functional differences, providing the same capabilities for ASG configuration","Launch Templates are the modern way to configure ASG instances (Launch Configurations are deprecated). Launch Templates provide: Versioning (can't modify, must create new version), Support for multiple instance types, Better integration with Auto Scaling and Spot Fleet, Parameter combinations, More flexibility than Launch Configurations. Launch Templates include: AMI, Instance Type, EC2 User Data, EBS Volumes, Security Groups, SSH Key Pair, IAM Roles, Network + Subnets.","Launch Templates can only be used with On-Demand instances while Launch Configurations are required for Reserved Instances and Spot Instances","Launch Templates require manual version management and cannot automatically track changes or maintain configuration history like Launch Configurations","B","A Launch Template (older Launch Configurations are deprecated) - AMI + Instance Type, EC2 User Data, EBS Volumes, Security Groups, SSH Key Pair, IAM Roles for your EC2 Instances, Network + Subnets Information, Load Balancer Information."
"What is the purpose of minimum, maximum, and desired capacity in an Auto Scaling Group?","These capacity settings are automatically determined by AWS and cannot be manually configured, as AWS optimizes capacity based on usage patterns","Minimum Capacity: The minimum number of instances that must always be running (ensures baseline availability). Maximum Capacity: The maximum number of instances that can be launched (prevents over-scaling and cost overruns). Desired Capacity: The target number of instances the ASG should maintain (can be between min and max). The ASG will launch or terminate instances to maintain the desired capacity.","Capacity settings only apply during business hours and are automatically disabled outside of scheduled operating times","Minimum and maximum capacity are fixed values that cannot be changed after ASG creation, while desired capacity can only be set manually for each scaling event","B","Auto Scaling Group Attributes: Min Size / Max Size / Initial Capacity. The ASG ensures we have a minimum and a maximum number of EC2 instances running. The ASG will scale to maintain the desired capacity between min and max."
"How do Load Balancer Security Groups work with EC2 instance Security Groups?","Security Groups are automatically configured by AWS with no manual setup required, and all traffic is allowed by default for maximum flexibility","Load Balancer Security Group: Allows inbound traffic from the internet (HTTP/HTTPS on ports 80/443). Application Security Group: Allows traffic only from the Load Balancer Security Group (restrict HTTP to Load Balancer). This creates a security layer where: Public traffic only reaches the Load Balancer, EC2 instances are not directly accessible from the internet, Traffic flows: Internet → Load Balancer → EC2 Instances.","Load balancer and EC2 security groups must have identical rules, as they cannot be configured independently for different security requirements","Security groups can only be applied at the VPC level and cannot be attached to individual load balancers or EC2 instances for granular access control","B","Load Balancer Security Group: Allow traffic from anywhere. Application Security Group: Allow traffic only from Load Balancer. This ensures EC2 instances are not directly exposed to the internet and traffic flows through the load balancer."
"What is the difference between internal and external (public) Load Balancers?","Internal and external load balancers provide identical functionality with no differences in security, performance, or configuration options","Internal Load Balancers: Have private IP addresses, can only be accessed from within the VPC or connected networks, used for internal applications, provide private access to backend services. External (Public) Load Balancers: Have public IP addresses, can be accessed from the internet, used for internet-facing applications, provide public access. Some load balancers can be setup as internal (private) or external (public) ELBs.","Internal load balancers can only be used with private subnets while external load balancers can only be used with public subnets, with no flexibility in deployment","Load balancers are automatically configured as external by default and cannot be changed to internal after creation, requiring complete recreation for private access","B","Some load balancers can be setup as internal (private) or external (public) ELBs. Internal load balancers have private IPs and are only accessible from within the VPC. External load balancers have public IPs and are accessible from the internet."
"What are Target Groups in the context of Application Load Balancers?","Target Groups are automatically created by AWS and cannot be manually configured, with all instances automatically added to a single default target group","Target Groups are used by Application Load Balancers to route traffic to registered targets (EC2 instances, IP addresses, Lambda functions, containers). Features: Health checks are performed at the target group level, Different target groups can have different health check settings, ALB can route to multiple target groups based on rules (path-based, host-based, content-based routing), Target groups enable advanced routing capabilities beyond simple round-robin.","Target Groups can only contain EC2 instances and cannot include other target types like IP addresses, Lambda functions, or containers","Target Groups are only used for Network Load Balancers and cannot be used with Application Load Balancers or Classic Load Balancers","B","Application Load Balancer (ALB) operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS), load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups), load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine. Target groups enable content-based routing and advanced load balancing features."
"What is Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity) in Load Balancers?","Sticky sessions are automatically enabled for all load balancers and cannot be disabled, ensuring all user sessions always connect to the same instance","Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity) enable the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific instance. This ensures that all requests from the same user are sent to the same instance. Useful for: Applications that store session data locally, Applications requiring consistent user experience, Cookie-based or duration-based stickiness. Can be enabled/disabled and configured with cookie expiration time.","Sticky sessions can only be used with Classic Load Balancers and are not available for Application Load Balancers or Network Load Balancers","Session affinity requires manual configuration for each user session and cannot be automatically managed by the load balancer","B","Sticky Sessions enable the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific instance. Enforce stickiness with cookies. This ensures consistent routing for session-based applications."
"What happens when an Auto Scaling Group scales out or scales in?","Scaling actions require manual approval and cannot be automatically executed, ensuring administrators have full control over instance changes","When ASG scales out: New EC2 instances are launched based on the Launch Template, Instances are automatically registered with the Load Balancer (if configured), Health checks begin on new instances, Instances become available to receive traffic once healthy. When ASG scales in: Instances are selected for termination (oldest instance or based on policy), Connection draining begins (stops new connections), In-flight requests complete, Instance is deregistered from Load Balancer, Instance is terminated.","Scaling out automatically terminates existing instances while scaling in launches new instances, with the processes being reversed from their names","Auto Scaling Groups can only scale during scheduled maintenance windows and cannot automatically respond to real-time demand changes","B","Auto Scaling Groups automatically register new instances to a load balancer. When scaling in, connection draining ensures in-flight requests complete before termination. The ASG re-creates an EC2 instance in case a previous one is terminated (ex: if unhealthy)."
"What is the difference between Simple Scaling and Step Scaling policies in Auto Scaling?","Simple Scaling and Step Scaling are identical policies that provide the same scaling behavior with no functional differences","Simple Scaling: When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered, add or remove a fixed number of instances. Example: If CPU > 70%, add 2 instances. Step Scaling: More advanced - adds or removes instances in steps based on how far the metric is beyond the threshold. Example: If CPU > 70%, add 2 instances; If CPU > 85%, add 5 instances. Step scaling provides more granular control and can respond differently to different levels of metric breach.","Simple Scaling can only be used with CPU metrics while Step Scaling requires custom metrics, limiting their applicability to different use cases","Scaling policies are automatically configured by AWS and cannot be customized or modified by users, providing fixed scaling behavior for all ASGs","B","Simple / Step Scaling: When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units; When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1. Step scaling provides more granular control based on how far the metric is beyond the threshold."
"What is Predictive Scaling in Auto Scaling Groups?","Predictive Scaling requires manual forecasting and cannot automatically predict future demand or schedule scaling actions ahead of time","Predictive Scaling continuously forecasts load and schedules scaling ahead. It uses machine learning to analyze historical metrics and predict future demand patterns. Benefits: Proactive scaling before demand increases, Better cost optimization, Reduced latency during traffic spikes, Automatic adjustment based on patterns. Works alongside other scaling policies (Target Tracking, Step Scaling) to provide optimal scaling behavior.","Predictive Scaling can only predict scaling needs for the next hour and cannot forecast longer-term demand patterns or seasonal variations","Predictive scaling is only available for Enterprise support plan customers and requires additional licensing fees to enable machine learning capabilities","B","Predictive scaling: continuously forecast load and schedule scaling ahead. This uses machine learning to analyze historical patterns and proactively scale before demand increases."
"What are the cost implications of using Load Balancers and Auto Scaling Groups?","Load balancers and Auto Scaling Groups have fixed monthly fees regardless of usage, making them expensive for low-traffic applications","Load Balancers: You pay for the load balancer service (hourly charge) and data processing. Auto Scaling Groups: ASGs are free (you only pay for the underlying EC2 instances). Cost benefits: Right-size instances based on demand (scale in when not needed), Use Reserved Instances for baseline capacity (minimum capacity), Use Spot Instances for cost savings where appropriate, Optimize by scaling down during low-traffic periods.","Both services require upfront payment and long-term commitments, with no pay-as-you-go pricing or cost optimization options available","Load balancer and ASG costs are automatically included in EC2 instance pricing with no separate charges, making them free to use","B","ASG are free (you only pay for the underlying EC2 instances).

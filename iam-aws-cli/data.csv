Key Point,1,"IAM Users represent people or applications that need access to AWS. IAM Roles provide temporary credentials to AWS services or users without storing access keys. Use Users for people needing console access. Use Roles for applications, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or cross-account access. Roles are more secure for programmatic access.","What is the difference between an IAM user and an IAM role, and when should you use each?"
Key Point,2,"IAM Groups are collections of IAM users that share permissions. Benefits: manage permissions for multiple users at once, users can belong to multiple groups, inheritance (users inherit permissions from all groups). Groups only contain users, not other groups. Simplifies permission management.","How do IAM Groups simplify permission management, and can a user belong to multiple groups?"
Key Point,3,"IAM Roles are preferred over access keys for EC2 instances because: roles provide temporary credentials (auto-refresh), no credentials stored on instance, no rotation needed, fine-grained permissions, integrated with AWS services. Access keys are permanent and must be manually rotated. Roles are more secure.","Why are IAM Roles preferred over access keys for applications running on EC2 instances?"
Key Point,4,"IAM Policies are JSON documents that define permissions. Structure: Version (2012-10-17), Statement array with Effect (Allow/Deny), Principal (who), Action (what operations), Resource (which resources), Condition (optional restrictions). Policies are attached to users, groups, or roles.","How do IAM policies define permissions, and what is the structure of an IAM policy document?"
Key Point,5,"Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds a second authentication factor. Enable via: IAM console → Users → Security credentials → Assign MFA device. Options: Virtual MFA (phone app), Hardware MFA (physical device). Critical for root accounts to prevent unauthorized access. Required for sensitive operations.","How can you enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM users, and why is it critical for root accounts?"
Key Point,6,"Least Privilege means granting only the minimum permissions needed. Implement via: specific resource ARNs instead of wildcards, specific actions needed, use conditions (IP, time, MFA), regular access reviews with IAM Access Advisor, remove unused permissions. Regular audits ensure compliance.","How can IAM policies be used to implement the principle of least privilege?"
Key Point,7,"Configure AWS CLI using: 'aws configure' command. Prompts for: Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region (e.g., us-east-1), output format (json/text/table). Credentials stored in ~/.aws/credentials (Linux/Mac) or %UserProfile%\.aws\credentials (Windows). Config stored in ~/.aws/config.","Describe the steps to configure the AWS CLI for a new user, and where are credentials stored?"
Key Point,8,"AWS CLI Profiles manage multiple sets of credentials. Create: 'aws configure --profile profilename'. Use: 'aws s3 ls --profile profilename' or set AWS_PROFILE environment variable. Profiles stored in ~/.aws/config and ~/.aws/credentials. Useful for managing multiple AWS accounts or roles.","How do AWS CLI profiles help manage multiple AWS accounts, and what command uses a specific profile?"
Key Point,9,"Command to list all S3 buckets: 'aws s3 ls'. List objects in bucket: 'aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name'. Copy file: 'aws s3 cp file.txt s3://bucket-name/'. Sync directory: 'aws s3 sync ./local-folder s3://bucket-name/folder/'.","What command would you use to list all S3 buckets in your AWS account using the AWS CLI?"
Key Point,10,"Change AWS CLI output format: use --output flag ('aws s3 ls --output table') or set default in config. Formats: json (best for scripting/parsing), table (human-readable), text (tab-separated). For scripting, JSON is preferred as it's easily parseable.","How can you change the output format of AWS CLI commands, and which format is best for scripting?"
Key Point,11,"AWS CLI pagination handles large result sets automatically. Options: --max-items (items per page), --page-size (control page size), --starting-token (continue from specific point). CLI automatically fetches next pages when needed. Use --no-paginate to disable.","How does AWS CLI pagination work, and what options are available for handling large result sets?"
Key Point,12,"Use AWS CLI in scripts by: chaining commands with &&, capturing output with variables, error handling with exit codes ($?), using --query for filtering JSON output, implementing retry logic for transient failures. Consider using jq for JSON parsing. Test error scenarios.","How can AWS CLI commands be used in scripts for automation, and what considerations are important for error handling?"
Key Point,13,"IAM Credential Report provides account-level audit of all IAM users and credentials. Information: password age, access key age, last usage dates, MFA status, credential status. Generate: IAM console → Credential report → Download. Use for security audits and compliance.","How can the IAM Credential Report help with security auditing, and what information does it provide?"
Key Point,14,"IAM Access Advisor shows user-level service permissions and last access dates. View: IAM → Users → select user → Access Advisor tab. Shows: which services user can access, when services were last accessed. Use to identify and remove unused permissions (least privilege).","What is the purpose of IAM Access Advisor, and how does it assist in managing IAM permissions?"
Key Point,15,"IAM Password Policies enforce strong password practices. Settings: minimum length, require uppercase/lowercase/numbers/symbols, password expiration, prevent reuse. Configure: IAM → Account settings → Password policy. Helps prevent unauthorized access and meet compliance requirements.","What security benefits do IAM Password Policies provide, and how do they help maintain account security?"
Key Point,16,"IAM Service Control Policies (SCPs) manage permissions across multiple AWS accounts in AWS Organizations. SCPs are guardrails that set maximum permissions (deny lists). Attach to: accounts, organizational units (OUs), or root. Work with IAM policies (SCP denies override IAM allows).","How can you manage permissions across multiple AWS accounts using IAM Service Control Policies?"
Key Point,17,"IAM Identity Federation allows users to access AWS using external identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, SAML providers, OIDC providers). Benefits: no need to create IAM users for each person, single sign-on (SSO), centralized identity management. Supports: SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, custom identity brokers.","What are the benefits of IAM Identity Federation, and what protocols does it support?"
Key Point,18,"IAM Resource-Based Policies attach directly to AWS resources (e.g., S3 bucket policies, Lambda resource policies). Difference: Identity-based policies attach to users/groups/roles, Resource-based policies attach to resources. Resource-based policies allow granting access without modifying user policies. Example: S3 bucket policy granting cross-account access.","How do IAM Resource-Based Policies differ from identity-based policies, and when should you use them?"
Key Point,19,"IAM Policy Simulator tests and troubleshoots IAM policies. Access: IAM console → Policy Simulator. Test: simulate API calls, see which policies allow/deny, identify policy conflicts, verify policy changes before deployment. Helps prevent permission errors in production.","How does the IAM Policy Simulator help with policy development and troubleshooting?"
Key Point,20,"IAM Policy Evaluation Logic determines access: 1) Explicit Deny always wins, 2) Explicit Allow grants access, 3) Default Deny if no explicit allow. Order: SCPs evaluated first, then all applicable identity/resource-based policies. If any policy denies, access is denied.","How does IAM policy evaluation logic determine whether to allow or deny an action?"
Key Point,21,"AWS CLI Waiters poll resources until they reach a desired state. Usage: 'aws ec2 wait instance-running --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0'. Benefits: automate waiting in scripts, avoid polling loops, built-in timeout handling. Useful for: waiting for instances to start, databases to be available, stacks to create.","How do AWS CLI waiters help with automation scripts, and give an example use case?"
Key Point,22,"IAM Managed Policies are AWS-predefined policies (e.g., AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess). Benefits: AWS-maintained (updates automatically), tested and reviewed, reusable across multiple entities, easier to manage. Use for common use cases. Inline policies are embedded in users/groups/roles and harder to manage.","What are the advantages of using IAM Managed Policies versus creating custom inline policies?"
Key Point,23,"IAM Inline Policies are embedded directly in users, groups, or roles. Use when: policy is unique to one entity, policy won't be reused, you want to ensure policy deletion with entity. Managed policies are preferred for reusability and maintenance. Inline policies have character limits.","When would you use IAM Inline Policies instead of Managed Policies?"
Key Point,24,"Install AWS CLI: macOS (Homebrew: 'brew install awscli'), Linux ('pip install awscli' or package manager), Windows (MSI installer). Requirements: Python 2.7+ or 3.4+ for v1, or standalone installer for v2. Verify: 'aws --version'. Latest is AWS CLI v2 (recommended).","What are the different methods to install the AWS CLI, and what are the system requirements?"
Key Point,25,"IAM Cross-Account Access allows users from one AWS account to access resources in another. Setup: create role in target account with trust policy allowing source account, user in source account assumes the role. Use case: centralized access management, shared resources, organizational accounts. Temporary credentials via STS.","How does IAM enable cross-account access, and what is required to set it up?"
Key Point,26,"AWS CLI Environment Variables override configuration. Variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, AWS_PROFILE, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (for temporary credentials). Priority: env vars > CLI options > config file > credentials file. Useful for scripts and CI/CD.","What AWS CLI environment variables are available, and how do they affect command execution?"
Key Point,27,"IAM Policy Conditions add restrictions to policies. Conditions specify when policies are effective. Types: String conditions (StringEquals, StringLike), Numeric conditions (NumericEquals), Date conditions (DateEquals), IP conditions (IpAddress), Bool conditions. Examples: require MFA, restrict to specific IPs, time-based access.","How do IAM Policy Conditions enhance security, and what types of conditions can be used?"
Key Point,28,"AWS CLI Query Filters use JMESPath syntax to extract specific data from JSON output. Usage: 'aws ec2 describe-instances --query \"Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,State.Name]\" --output table'. JMESPath is a query language for JSON. Useful for: filtering, transforming, extracting specific fields.","How can AWS CLI query filters help process command output, and what is JMESPath?"
Key Point,29,"IAM Permissions Boundaries set maximum permissions for IAM entities (users/roles). They limit what permissions can be granted via policies. Use case: delegate user/role creation to others while limiting what permissions they can grant. Permissions boundaries work alongside regular policies (both must allow).","What is the purpose of IAM Permissions Boundaries, and how do they work with regular policies?"
Key Point,30,"AWS CLI S3 Sync synchronizes files/directories to/from S3. Command: 'aws s3 sync ./local s3://bucket/path/'. Features: only transfers changed/new files (efficient), preserves metadata, can delete files in destination, supports include/exclude filters, recursive. More efficient than individual copy commands for large directories.","How does aws s3 sync work, and what makes it more efficient than individual copy commands?"

Key Point,1,"IAM Users - Entities representing individuals or applications that interact with AWS, with unique credentials and permissions.","What is the difference between an IAM user and an IAM role, and when should you use each?"

Key Point,5,"Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - Adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification beyond just a username and password.","How can you enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for IAM users, and why is it critical for root accounts?"
Key Point,6,"IAM Best Practices - Implement least privilege, enable MFA for all users, use roles for applications, and regularly rotate credentials.","How can IAM policies be used to implement the principle of least privilege?"
Key Point,7,"AWS CLI Configuration - Set up using aws configure command to input Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format.","Describe the steps to configure the AWS CLI for a new user, and where are credentials stored?"
Key Point,8,"AWS CLI Profiles - Support for multiple named profiles to manage different sets of credentials for different AWS accounts or roles.","How do AWS CLI profiles help manage multiple AWS accounts, and what command uses a specific profile?"
Key Point,9,"AWS CLI Commands - Structured as aws <service> <command>, such as aws s3 ls to list S3 buckets or aws ec2 describe-instances to view EC2 instances.","What command would you use to list all S3 buckets in your AWS account using the AWS CLI?"
Key Point,10,"AWS CLI Output Formats - Supports JSON, table, and text formats for command outputs, configurable via --output flag or default settings.","How can you change the output format of AWS CLI commands, and which format is best for scripting?"
Key Point,11,"AWS CLI Pagination - Handles large sets of results by automatically paginating responses, with options to control page size and retrieve all pages.","How does AWS CLI pagination work, and what options are available for handling large result sets?"
Key Point,12,"AWS CLI Scripting - Integrate CLI commands into shell scripts for automation, enabling automated deployments, monitoring, and resource management.","How can AWS CLI commands be used in scripts for automation, and what considerations are important for error handling?"
Key Point,13,"IAM Credential Report - Provides a report of all IAM users and the status of their credentials, including password age, access key age, and last usage.","How can the IAM Credential Report help with security auditing, and what information does it provide?"
Key Point,14,"IAM Access Advisor - Shows service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed, helping identify unused permissions.","What is the purpose of IAM Access Advisor, and how does it assist in managing IAM permissions?"
Key Point,15,"IAM Password Policies - Define complexity requirements, minimum length, password expiration, and prevent password reuse to enforce strong password practices.","What security benefits do IAM Password Policies provide, and how do they help maintain account security?"
Key Point,16,"IAM Service Control Policies (SCPs) - Manage permissions across multiple AWS accounts in AWS Organizations, establishing guardrails for what actions can be performed.","How can you manage permissions across multiple AWS accounts using IAM Service Control Policies?"
Key Point,17,"IAM Identity Federation - Allows users to access AWS resources using external identity providers like Active Directory, without creating IAM users for each person.","What are the benefits of IAM Identity Federation, and what protocols does it support?"
Key Point,18,"IAM Resource-Based Policies - Attach policies directly to AWS resources (like S3 buckets) for fine-grained access control without modifying user policies.","How do IAM Resource-Based Policies differ from identity-based policies, and when should you use them?"
Key Point,19,"IAM Policy Simulator - Test and troubleshoot IAM policies to ensure they grant the intended permissions before deploying them in production.","How does the IAM Policy Simulator help with policy development and troubleshooting?"
Key Point,20,"IAM Policy Evaluation Logic - Determines access by evaluating explicit denies first, then explicit allows, with default deny if no explicit allow is found.","How does IAM policy evaluation logic determine whether to allow or deny an action?"
Key Point,21,"AWS CLI Waiters - Automate waiting for resources to reach a desired state before proceeding, useful in automation scripts.","How do AWS CLI waiters help with automation scripts, and give an example use case?"
Key Point,22,"IAM Managed Policies - Pre-built policies maintained by AWS that cover common use cases, making it easier to grant permissions without writing custom policies.","What are the advantages of using IAM Managed Policies versus creating custom inline policies?"
Key Point,23,"IAM Inline Policies - Policies embedded directly in a user, group, or role, providing a simple way to grant permissions without creating separate policy documents.","When would you use IAM Inline Policies instead of Managed Policies?"
Key Point,24,"AWS CLI Installation - Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux; can be installed via package managers, installers, or using pip for Python-based installation.","What are the different methods to install the AWS CLI, and what are the system requirements?"
Key Point,25,"IAM Cross-Account Access - Allows users from one AWS account to access resources in another account using roles, enabling secure resource sharing.","How does IAM enable cross-account access, and what is required to set it up?"
Key Point,26,"AWS CLI Environment Variables - Can override configuration settings using environment variables like AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.","What AWS CLI environment variables are available, and how do they affect command execution?"
Key Point,27,"IAM Policy Conditions - Additional controls in policies that specify when a policy is in effect, such as time-based access, IP restrictions, or MFA requirements.","How do IAM Policy Conditions enhance security, and what types of conditions can be used?"
Key Point,28,"AWS CLI Query Filters - Use JMESPath query syntax with --query parameter to filter and transform command output to extract specific data.","How can AWS CLI query filters help process command output, and what is JMESPath?"
Key Point,29,"IAM Permissions Boundaries - Set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity, providing an extra layer of security.","What is the purpose of IAM Permissions Boundaries, and how do they work with regular policies?"
Key Point,30,"AWS CLI S3 Sync - Powerful command to sync files and directories to/from S3, only transferring changed files, useful for backups and deployments.","How does aws s3 sync work, and what makes it more efficient than individual copy commands?"

"What is the difference between an IAM user and an IAM role, and when should you use each?","A database service for storing user information","IAM Users represent people or applications that need access to AWS.

Roles are more secure for programmatic access.","A compute service for running applications","A storage service for user data","B","IAM Users represent people or applications that need access to AWS.

Question,OptionA,OptionB,OptionC,OptionD,CorrectAnswer,Explanation
"What is the difference between an IAM user and an IAM role, and when should you use each?","IAM Users are for applications only, while IAM Roles are exclusively for human users requiring console access with permanent credentials","IAM Users represent people or applications needing access to AWS. IAM Roles provide temporary credentials to AWS services or users without storing access keys. Use Users for people needing console access. Use Roles for applications, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or cross-account access. Roles are more secure for programmatic access.","IAM Users provide temporary credentials that expire after 24 hours, while IAM Roles provide permanent credentials stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager","IAM Users and Roles are identical in functionality, with the only difference being the naming convention and visual representation in the AWS Console","B","IAM Users represent people or applications that need access to AWS. IAM Roles provide temporary credentials to AWS services or users without storing access keys. Use Users for people needing console access. Use Roles for applications, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or cross-account access. Roles are more secure for programmatic access."
"How do IAM Groups simplify permission management, and can a user belong to multiple groups?","IAM Groups can contain other groups in a hierarchical structure, and users can only belong to one group at a time to maintain clear permission boundaries","IAM Groups are collections of IAM users that share permissions. Benefits: manage permissions for multiple users at once, users can belong to multiple groups, inheritance (users inherit permissions from all groups). Groups only contain users, not other groups. Simplifies permission management.","IAM Groups are automatically created based on user email domains and cannot be manually configured or modified by administrators","IAM Groups require each user to have identical permissions with no flexibility for individual user customization or exception handling","B","IAM Groups are collections of IAM users that share permissions. Benefits: manage permissions for multiple users at once, users can belong to multiple groups, inheritance (users inherit permissions from all groups). Groups only contain users, not other groups. Simplifies permission management."
"Why are IAM Roles preferred over access keys for applications running on EC2 instances?","Access keys provide better security with automatic rotation every 30 days and fine-grained permission control compared to IAM Roles","IAM Roles are preferred because: roles provide temporary credentials (auto-refresh), no credentials stored on instance, no rotation needed, fine-grained permissions, integrated with AWS services. Access keys are permanent and must be manually rotated. Roles are more secure.","IAM Roles require manual credential management and rotation, while access keys are automatically managed by AWS with built-in security features and encryption","Access keys and IAM Roles provide identical security and functionality, making the choice purely based on personal preference and deployment convenience","B","IAM Roles are preferred over access keys for EC2 instances because: roles provide temporary credentials (auto-refresh), no credentials stored on instance, no rotation needed, fine-grained permissions, integrated with AWS services. Access keys are permanent and must be manually rotated. Roles are more secure."
"How do IAM policies define permissions, and what is the structure of an IAM policy document?","IAM policies are XML documents with a hierarchical structure that defines permissions using tags and attributes for users, groups, and roles","IAM Policies are JSON documents that define permissions. Structure: Version (2012-10-17), Statement array with Effect (Allow/Deny), Principal (who), Action (what operations), Resource (which resources), Condition (optional restrictions).

"How can IAM policies be used to implement the principle of least privilege?","Grant all users administrative access by default and restrict permissions only when security incidents occur or compliance audits require changes","Least Privilege means granting only the minimum permissions needed. Implement via: specific resource ARNs instead of wildcards, specific actions needed, use conditions (IP, time, MFA), regular access reviews with IAM Access Advisor, remove unused permissions. Regular audits ensure compliance.","Use wildcard permissions for all resources and actions to ensure users have maximum flexibility and can perform any required tasks without permission errors","Automatically grant permissions based on user job titles and department affiliations without reviewing actual access requirements or usage patterns","B","Least Privilege means granting only the minimum permissions needed.

"How can you change the output format of AWS CLI commands, and which format is best for scripting?","AWS CLI output format is fixed and cannot be changed, with all commands returning data in a standardized XML format regardless of configuration","Change AWS CLI output format: use --output flag ('aws s3 ls --output table') or set default in config. Formats: json (best for scripting/parsing), table (human-readable), text (tab-separated). For scripting, JSON is preferred as it's easily parseable.","Output format can only be changed by modifying system-level configuration files that require administrator privileges and system restart to take effect","The output format is automatically determined by AWS based on the command type, with compute commands using JSON and storage commands using table format by default","B","Change AWS CLI output format: use --output flag ('aws s3 ls --output table') or set default in config.

Question,OptionA,OptionB,OptionC,OptionD,CorrectAnswer,Explanation
"What is an EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume?","A physical drive attached directly to EC2 instances","A network drive that can be attached to EC2 instances while they run, allowing data persistence even after termination","A global storage service accessible from anywhere","A temporary storage that is deleted when instance stops","B","An EBS Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run.

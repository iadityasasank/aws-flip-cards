"How do you apply the AWS Well-Architected Framework principles to EC2-based architectures?","The Well-Architected Framework is automatically applied to all EC2 architectures by AWS, requiring no manual implementation or consideration of framework principles","Well-Architected Framework Application: Operational Excellence (automation, monitoring, documentation, change management), Security (encryption, access control, vulnerability management, incident response), Reliability (multi-AZ, health checks, backup, disaster recovery), Performance Efficiency (right-sizing, monitoring, trade-offs, selection), Cost Optimization (right-sizing, reserved capacity, eliminate waste, monitor costs). Apply each pillar specifically to EC2: right-size instances, use appropriate storage, implement monitoring, ensure security, plan for failures.","The Well-Architected Framework only applies to serverless architectures and cannot be used for EC2-based deployments, which require different architectural principles","Applying the Well-Architected Framework requires complete architecture redesign and cannot be incrementally implemented in existing EC2-based systems","B","Well-Architected Framework Application: Operational Excellence (automation, monitoring, documentation, change management), Security (encryption, access control, vulnerability management, incident response), Reliability (multi-AZ, health checks, backup, disaster recovery), Performance Efficiency (right-sizing, monitoring, trade-offs, selection), Cost Optimization (right-sizing, reserved capacity, eliminate waste, monitor costs).
